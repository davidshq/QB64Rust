# The QB64Rust compiler crates

The new compiler, `qb64rust`. One crate per pipeline stage, so the layering is enforced by the dependency graph
(design of the OpenSpec change `m2-workspace-and-slice`, D1). Dependencies point only downward.

| Crate | Package | What it holds |
|---|---|---|
| `base` | `qb64rust-base` | `FileId`, byte `Span`, `SourceMap` with the line index (CR LF, LF, lone CR), `Diagnostic`, the 100-error cap |
| `syntax` | `qb64rust-syntax` | Byte lexer, lossless tree (green nodes + cursor; printing it gives back the file byte for byte), parser with one module per statement family (`parser\keywords.rs`: the reserved words), typed accessors over the tree (`ast.rs`: one wrapper per node kind, every child an `Option` or an iterator), the old compiler's rule for metacommands in comments (`meta.rs`); the program's trees (`program.rs`: one `Tree` per file per inclusion, `ParsedProgram`, the `Loader` for included files; a node's `key()` is its tree and offset) |
| `builtins` | `qb64rust-builtins` | The built-in table, generated at build time from `tools\builtins\builtins.json` |
| `sema` | `qb64rust-sema` | Procedure table, scopes (main, procedure, `STATIC`, `SHARED`), variables (a name plus a type), labels, constants (`CONST`, `consteval.rs`), literal typing, computation types, explicit conversions, by-reference or by-value arguments, integer constant folding; the typed tree; the symbol table (`symbols.rs`: definition and references of every variable, procedure, label and constant, `Symbols::at` for a position, `dump_symbols`) |
| `ir` | `qb64rust-ir` | The ABI-neutral IR (no libqb names, no C types: procedures, storage classes, `Arg::Ref`/`Arg::Temp`, handlers and `RESUME` as statement-level rules) and its lowering from the typed tree |
| `codegen-cpp` | `qb64rust-codegen-cpp` | IR to the fragments `qbx.cpp` includes (`global.txt`, `main0.txt`, ...) |
| `driver` | `qb64rust-driver` | The `qb64rust` binary: command line, pipeline, build through the reference clone's `Makefile` |

```

Source is bytes throughout (`study\15` §1): files are never converted to `str`; positions are byte offsets;
columns in diagnostics are byte columns.

## Lints

`cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` must be clean (CI runs it). Beyond the defaults
(`study\21`):

- `sema`, `ir`, `codegen-cpp`: no `_ =>` arm on an enum (`wildcard_enum_match_arm`). List the variants; where a
  default is right, say why in `#[expect(clippy::wildcard_enum_match_arm, reason = "...")]`. The lint sees only
  `match`: write a type predicate or a per-type choice as a `match`, not as `==` or `if … else`.
- `clippy.toml` disallows converting bytes to `str` (`from_utf8`, `from_utf8_lossy`) and reading text
  (`read_to_string`, `read_line`, `BufRead::lines`). Show source bytes with `show_bytes`.
- Casts that can lose or reinterpret bits are linted. Lengths, offsets and ids use `base::to_u32` (source files are
  at most `MAX_SOURCE_LEN`); a deliberate wrap keeps its `as` with `#[expect]` and the reason.
- Release builds keep overflow checks: arithmetic BASIC defines as wrapping is written `wrapping_*`.

## Building and running

```
cargo build --release
target\release\qb64rust.exe -x prog.bas -o prog.exe        # compile (needs ..\QB64pe, see below)
target\release\qb64rust.exe -z prog.bas                    # write the C++ fragments only, print their folder (kept)
target\release\qb64rust.exe --dump typed prog.bas          # tokens | tree | typed | ir | cpp
```

Building an executable uses the QB64pe reference clone for `qbx.cpp`, libqb and the toolchain: `--qb64pe-root
<dir>`, else the environment variable `QB64RUST_QB64PE_ROOT`, else `..\QB64pe` next to this repository. The
fragments, the copy of `qbx.cpp`, `qbx.o` and the `.sym` file go into `<exe>.qb64rust\` next to the executable
(characters other than `A-Z a-z 0-9 . _ -` in that folder name become `_`, because `make` cannot take them; the
executable is linked there and moved into place; the folder is deleted after a successful build unless
`--keep-build`); libqb objects are built into the clone's git-ignored folders if missing. No tracked file of the
clone changes. `-z` keeps that folder: run over many files (to collect diagnostics), it leaves a
`<name>.exe.qb64rust\temp\` next to every program without errors, so give `-o` a scratch folder outside the repo and
the clone, or use `--dump tree`. The QB64pe Windows release works as the root too (CI uses it). `-f:OptimizeCppProgram=true` builds
with `-O2` as `qb64pe` does; `-f:StripDebugSymbols=...` is ignored; other `-f:` settings are "not supported yet".

What the compiler supports so far:

- the first slice (`m2-workspace-and-slice`): `$CONSOLE:ONLY`, comments, `:`, `DIM` of scalars (`INTEGER`,
  `LONG`, `_INTEGER64`, `SINGLE`, `DOUBLE`, `_FLOAT`, `STRING`), `[LET] v = e`, implicit variables with suffixes,
  `PRINT` with `;`, `,` and the auto-semicolon, `END`, numeric and string literals, unary `-`, `+ - * /`,
  parentheses, string `+`, and `INSTR`;
- procedures (`m2-procedures-and-errors`): `SUB` and `FUNCTION` with parameters, calls with and without `CALL`
  (by reference or by value as in QB64pe), function calls in expressions, `EXIT SUB`/`EXIT FUNCTION`, `DECLARE`
  (ignored, as QB64pe does), local and implicit variables, `STATIC`, `SHARED`, `DIM SHARED`, reserved names;
  `SYSTEM` without an exit code;
- error handling: labels in the main module, `ON ERROR GOTO label` and `ON ERROR GOTO 0` (also inside a
  procedure), `RESUME`, `RESUME NEXT`, `RESUME label`, `ERROR n`, `ERR`, `ERL`, `CHR$`;
- every operator (`m2-control-flow-slice`): comparisons (`=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, numbers and strings),
  `NOT`, `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, `EQV`, `IMP`, `_ANDALSO`, `_ORELSE`, `_NEGATE`, `\`, `MOD`, `^`, typed as QB64pe types
  them (`sema\src\check\ops.rs`); an `IMP` whose left operand is an `IMP` is "not supported yet" (QB64pe
  computes `a IMP b IMP c` as `a OR b OR c`);
- `CONST` (`m2-control-flow-slice` task 4.2): the old compiler's constant evaluator (`sema\src\consteval.rs`, the
  walk in `sema\src\check\constants.rs`), its typing (`_INTEGER64`, DOUBLE, or the suffix's type), main and
  procedure scopes as measured; uses become literal nodes. Floats are computed in `f64` and checked for being the
  value the old compiler's `_FLOAT` path gives; where that cannot be shown, and for the evaluator's functions,
  the constant is "not supported yet".

Anything else gets a "not supported yet" error, never wrong code. Parsed into typed nodes but still marked by
`sema` (`m2-parser-breadth`, in progress): member access, `DATA`/`READ`/`RESTORE`, line numbers,
`GOTO`/`GOSUB`/`RETURN`, and every block (`IF` in both forms, `FOR`, `DO`, `WHILE`, `SELECT CASE`, `TYPE`,
`DECLARE LIBRARY`, `EXIT` of each); `DEF FN` is an error, as in QB64pe.

A panic is reported as `qb64rust: internal compiler error: <message> at <source location>`, with the input file;
the executable is removed and the exit code is 3 (every other failure exits with 1). `QB64RUST_TEST_PANIC=1`
panics on purpose, for the CLI test only.

## Tests

| Tier (`study\19`) | Command | What |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `cargo test` | Unit tests; lexer and parser snapshots; symbol-table snapshots; `tests\frontend\` by mode line; every input set through the front end (`inputs.rs`: corpus, `tests\upstream`, snippets, and from the clone `qbasic_testcases` and the old compiler's sources; no panic, exact round trip, the copy equals the clone, the two lists of `tests\upstream\README.md`); the programs of `tests\corpus\slice.list` without diagnostics; every program with an `.err` file rejected; reserved names against the measured list (`names.rs`); the seeded mutation test (`mutate.rs`); the command line |
| 1, by hand | `cargo test -p qb64rust-driver --test cli -- --ignored` | The command-line scenarios that build an executable |
| 2 | `python tools\legacy_tests\run_legacy_tests.py --suite corpus --qb64 target\release\qb64rust.exe --list tests\corpus\slice.list` | The listed corpus programs end to end against the output recorded from `qb64pe.exe` |
| 2 | `python tools\legacy_tests\run_legacy_tests.py --suite compile --qb64 target\release\qb64rust.exe --list tests\upstream\pass.list` | The upstream programs of the pass list end to end (`tests\upstream\README.md`); also in CI (`rust.yml`, job `tier2`) |

**"Not supported yet."** A diagnostic either reports an error in the program or is marked "not supported yet"
(`Diagnostic::unsupported`, printed `error: not supported yet: <message>`; the summary says how many). `sema` and
the parser mark every construct they do not handle; the parser also marks a generic syntax error ("expected ...")
at a BASIC word or operator (`syntax_error`). The two lists in `tests\` hold the programs where this does not yet
match the old compiler's verdict; after a change, regenerate them with `QB64RUST_UPDATE_LISTS=1 cargo test -p
qb64rust-driver --test inputs` and review the diff (entries may only go away).

**Mutation test.** `QB64RUST_MUTATE_SEED` and `QB64RUST_MUTATE_COUNT` (mutants per corpus program, default 20)
change the run; a failure prints the seed to rerun with and writes the mutant to `target\mutate-failure.bas`.

Time of tier 1, measured 2026-10-07 after `m2-control-flow-slice` (debug build already built, 16 threads, clone
present): `cargo test` takes 4.9–5.4 s over three runs, `inputs.rs` 2.4 s of it (on 2026-10-04: about 3 s, `inputs.rs`
1.4–2.9 s for about 1,000 files, run on all cores). The budget is a minute (design of `m2-upstream-tests`); past
it, the clone sets would run in release only.

`tests\frontend\*.bas` start with a mode line, `' TEST: <mode>`:

| Mode | Checks |
|---|---|
| `parse-ok` | no syntax errors; the tree prints back to the file |
| `check-ok` | no errors after `sema` |
| `check-fail` | at least one error; the diagnostics are a snapshot |
| `typed`, `ir`, `cpp` | no errors; the typed tree, the IR or the C++ fragments are a snapshot |

The mode line is a comment, so `qb64pe.exe` ignores it.

### Snapshots

Snapshot tests use [`insta`](https://insta.rs). The `.snap` files are committed next to the tests
(`crates\syntax\tests\snapshots\`, `crates\sema\tests\snapshots\`, `crates\driver\tests\snapshots\`, the last named `<file>.<mode>.snap`). A
changed output fails `cargo test` and writes a `.snap.new` file. Review with `cargo insta review` (install with
`cargo install cargo-insta`) or read the `.snap.new` file and rename it over the `.snap` file to accept it. To
write all new snapshots in one run: `INSTA_FORCE_PASS=1 INSTA_UPDATE=new cargo test`, then review every
`.snap.new`.

`QB64RUST_NO_FOLD=1` turns integer constant folding off; it is for checking that folding changes no result (run
tier 2 with it set), not for normal use.
