# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The whole language parses
Every statement and expression form the old compiler accepts SHALL parse into a node of its own kind, without a
parser diagnostic. A construct that the later stages do not compile yet SHALL be reported "not supported yet" by
`sema` at that node, not by the parser.

#### Scenario: Statement not compiled yet
- **WHEN** a program contains `DO: SWAP a, b: LOOP UNTIL a > 0`
- **THEN** the tree has a `DoBlock` holding a `SwapStmt`, and the only diagnostic is one "not supported yet" error
  at `SWAP`

#### Scenario: Built-in statement read by its template
- **WHEN** a program contains `LINE (0, 0)-(9, 9), , BF`
- **THEN** it parses into one `BuiltinStmt` with `BF` as a word, not as a variable

#### Scenario: Member access after an index
- **WHEN** a program contains `PRINT a(1).b`
- **THEN** it parses without a diagnostic, and the item is a member access on `a(1)`
